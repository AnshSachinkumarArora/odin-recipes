        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Nobody makes casserole like your Grandma.</p>
        <p>That's why this old-fashioned ground beef casserole with egg noodles is always such a hit! It's made with ingredients you already have on hand (and, of course, a little bit of love).</p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Ground Beef</li>
            <li>Tomato Sauce</li>
            <li>Pasta</li>
            <li>Sour Cream and Cream Cheese</li>
            <li>Seasoning</li>
            <li>Onions</li>
            <li>Cheddar Cheese</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Cook and Season the Ground Beef:</strong> Cook the beef in a skillet over medium-high heat until it's brown and crumbly. Drain and discard the grease. Mix tomato sauce, sugar, garlic salt, and salt into the ground beef and simmer until the flavors blend. Remove from heat and allow to cool.</li>
            <li><strong>Cook Egg Noodles:</strong> Boil the egg noodles until they're cooked through, but are still quite firm. Drain in a colander and allow to cool slightly.</li>
            <li><strong>Mix Sour Cream and Cream Cheese: </strong> Mix the sour cream, cream cheese, and diced onion in a medium bowl until well-combined.</li>
            <li><strong>Assemble and Bake:</strong> Layer half of the egg noodles into a greased casserole dish. Top with half of the sour cream mixture, then half of the beef mixture. Repeat in the same order. Sprinkle the top layer of beef with cheese. Bake until the cheese is melted and golden, about 25-30 minutes.</li>
        </ol>
